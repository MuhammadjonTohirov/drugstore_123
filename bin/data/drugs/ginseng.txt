Ginseng is a root of plants in the Panax genus, including Korean ginseng (P. ginseng), South China ginseng (P. notoginseng), and American ginseng (P. quinquefolius). It contains ginsenosides and gintonin and is commonly used in Chinese and Korean cuisines and medicines.

Traditional medicine has used ginseng for centuries, but modern clinical research has not provided enough evidence of its medical effectiveness. In the United States, the FDA has not approved its use as a prescription drug. Ginseng is often sold as a dietary supplement, but inconsistent manufacturing practices have led to products being contaminated with toxic metals or filler compounds. Excessive use of ginseng may have adverse effects or interact negatively with prescription drugs.
